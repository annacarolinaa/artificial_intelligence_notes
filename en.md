Welcome to my portfolio of projects in **Applied Artificial Intelligence**.  
This repository gathers all my reports and experiments in **Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on data analysis, machine learning, and results interpretation.

### Included Projects

1. **Financial Inclusion**  
   - Analysis of factors influencing financial inclusion across different populations.  
   - Use of regression, classification, and data preprocessing to model trends.

2. **Happiness**  
   - Exploration of data related to well-being and life satisfaction.  
   - Application of predictive models to understand happiness indicators and social patterns.

3. **Obesity**  
   - Study of factors contributing to obesity using demographic and behavioral data.  
   - Risk modeling and analysis of correlations between lifestyle habits and health.

4. **Grades (Academic Performance)**  
   - Evaluation of variables impacting grades and school performance.  
   - Application of regression and classification algorithms to predict academic outcomes.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: main language for analysis and modeling.  
- **Pandas, NumPy**: data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **Scikit-learn**: linear regression, logistic regression, pipelines, and preprocessing.  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: data visualization and exploratory analysis.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: documentation of experiments and reports.

### Repository Objective

- Consolidate practical learning in applied AI.  
- Organize experiments in a clear, reproducible, and well-documented way.  
- Demonstrate the application of data analysis and machine learning in real-world contexts: social, educational, health, and economic.
